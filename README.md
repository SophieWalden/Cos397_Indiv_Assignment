# Cos397_Indiv_Assignment

This repository uses a couple pre-commit hooks to run the black and flake8 for autoformatting/linting. It has sorting functions dehfined in test/int_sort.py which are then properly tested using testcases with pytest. All of this is tested in the pre-commit on python3.9/3.10 and windows/mac/ubuntu. This was a collaborate repo meant to gain a basic understanding of how Github actions work
